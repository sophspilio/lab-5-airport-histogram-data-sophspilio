# Analyzing Airport Data
Sophie Spiliotopoulos
IDCE 30274 Lab 5
Due Nov. 20, 2020

Through four coding challenges, this lab walks through airport and route data from [Open Flights](https://openflights.org/data.html). 
This script will print all airports for a given country, create dictionaries with the airport IDs and the corresponding latitude/longitudes, create a list of all route distances, and create a histogram showing frequency of route distances. 

To maniuplate the `.csv` and `.dat` files, I used the `csv` module and a for loop to traverse the data and edit row by row. 

See the attached Google Colab notebook for script.
