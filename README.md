# Analyzing Airport Data
Sophie Spiliotopoulos
IDCE 30274 Lab 5
Due Nov. 20, 2020

Through four coding challenges, this lab walks through airport and route data from [Open Flights](https://openflights.org/data.html). 
This script will print all airports for a given country, create dictionaries with the airport IDs and the corresponding latitude/longitudes, create a list of all route distances, and create a histogramshowing frequency of route distances.
